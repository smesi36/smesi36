## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Erekle (Erek) from New Zealand. 
I have been working on individual and team-based projects as part of the Diploma in Digital Technology and Design, Mission Ready HQ, Auckland.
I have enjoyed learning and working across the full stack using React, Node.js, MySQL (SQL), and MongoDB (NoSQL). I have also enjoyed learning AI tools such as Azure Custom Vision and Google Gemini and have applied them in some of my projects. 
I have also enjoyed practicing Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Docker deployment.

Currently I am still completing my diploma and I look forward to starting my career as a full-stack developer.
