## Hi, I'm Erekle ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer from from New Zealand. 
I have worked on individual and team-based projects as part of the Diploma in Digital Technology and Design, Mission Ready HQ, Auckland.
I have enjoyed building web apps using React, Node.js, MySQL (SQL), and MongoDB (NoSQL) and powering my projects with AI tools such as Azure Custom Vision and Google Gemini. 
Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Docker deployment are other aspects of development I have enjoyed.
I also enjoy working alongside UX designers, working from Figma wireframes. 

Currently I am still completing my diploma and I look forward to starting my career as a full-stack developer.
