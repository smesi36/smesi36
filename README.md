![Full-Stack Software Developer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/smesi36/smesi36/refs/heads/main/Erekle%20Sesiashvili%20GitHub.png)

Iâ€™m a software developer from New Zealand currently enrolled in Diploma in Digital Technology and Design at Mission Ready HQ (Auckland).

I enjoy building full-stack web apps with React, Node.js, MongoDB, and MySQL, and exploring AI integrations using tools like Azure Custom Vision and Google Gemini. I'm also a fan of Test-Driven Development (TDD), working with Docker, and collaborating with UX designers from Figma wireframes.

Iâ€™m excited to start my journey as a full-stack developer and continue building clean, scalable, and user-focused applications.

Skills: REACT / JS / HTML / CSS / Node.js / MongoDB / MySQL
